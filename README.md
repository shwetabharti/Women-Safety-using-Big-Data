# Women-Safety-using-Big-Data

Safety of women is a big issue in India, especially during night time. Since most people in India rely on railways for travelling to different states, and most often, trains reach various stations in night. This situation arises concerns for female safety at those places. 

This project aims at providing the number of trains departing/arriving from/to their respective stations during night, statewise. This is combined with the 'crime against women' rates provided in each state of India, to analyze that this could be a potential cause for those crimes.

Dataset is taken from Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India (https://data.gov.in/catalog/indian-railways-train-time-table-0#web_catalog_tabs_block_10).
